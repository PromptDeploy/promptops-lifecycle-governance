# Examples

This folder contains full lifecycle examples that demonstrate how to use the PromptOps governance artifact in practice.

These examples are designed for:

- LLM engineers implementing CI-gated prompt development workflows
- Governance leads evaluating reproducibility, rollback, and eval coverage
- SaaS SDK platform teams interested in artifact reuse and adoption

Each file in this directory walks through real prompt lifecycle flows using the actual schemas, configs, and evaluation scaffolds from this repo.
